# Peer-to-Peer

Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a decentralized computing model in which nodes in a network communicate and share resources directly with each other, rather than relying on a central server or authority. In a P2P system, each node acts as both a client and a server, and is able to request and provide resources to other nodes in the network.

P2P systems are often used to create distributed networks, in which resources and data are shared among a large number of nodes. They are designed to be resilient, scalable, and flexible, as they do not rely on a central point of control or a single point of failure.

P2P systems have a wide range of applications, including file sharing, content distribution, and distributed computing. They are used to create decentralized networks that are resistant to censorship and tampering, and are able to operate without the need for a central authority.
