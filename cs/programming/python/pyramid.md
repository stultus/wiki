# Pyramid

Pyramid is a web framework for Python that is designed for flexibility and scalability. It is based on the "model-view-controller" (MVC) architecture, which separates an application's data model, user interface, and control logic into three distinct components. Pyramid provides a variety of features and tools for building web applications, including support for routing, templates, and validation. It is also designed to be easily extensible, allowing developers to add custom functionality as needed. Pyramid is suitable for a wide range of web development projects, from small prototypes to large, enterprise-level applications.
