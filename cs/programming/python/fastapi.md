# FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7 and later. It is built on top of Starlette, a lightweight ASGI framework, and is inspired by previous web frameworks such as Flask and Falcon. FastAPI is designed to be easy to use and learn, with a simple and intuitive interface. It includes features such as automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation, as well as support for asynchronous programming and dependency injection. FastAPI is suitable for a wide range of use cases, including building microservices, creating APIs for machine learning models, and serving as the foundation for serverless applications.
