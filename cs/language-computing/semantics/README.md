# Semantics

[Semantics](./) is the study of meaning.  Computational Semantics is the study of automating constructing and reasoning with [meaning representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics).&#x20;

> Semantics is the study of meaning. It investigates questions such as: What is meaning? How come words and sentences have meaning? What _is_ the meaning of words and sentences? How can the meanings of words combine to form the meaning of sentences? Do two people _mean_ the same thing when they utter the word ‘cat’? How do we communicate? Etc, etc.  - [Dr. Aurelie Herbelot](https://aurelieherbelot.net/)
