# Character Building

Character building is an important aspect of screenwriting, as it helps to create fully-realized and believable characters that audiences can connect with. This involves developing each character's backstory, motivations, goals, personality, and relationships with other characters. It's important to think about how a character's actions and decisions will drive the story forward and how they will change and grow throughout the course of the film or television show. By giving characters depth and complexity, screenwriters can create engaging and dynamic stories that will keep audiences invested and invested in the characters.
