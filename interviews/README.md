# Interviews

On the following sub pages, you will find links to a series of interviews I conducted with experts in their fields. These interviews are categorized based on the language spoken, with some conducted in English and others in Malayalam. These individuals have generously shared their experiences, insights, and perspectives on a wide range of topics. I hope that you will find these interviews informative and thought-provoking as you navigate your own career or research interests.
