#### When to use surveys:

* Measure changes over time (such as satisfaction or uptake)
* Quantify characteristics of users
* Measure attitudes or intents
* Measure product usage or activity

**Respondents**

For surveys, it's better to have a significant number of responses. "Significant" can mean different things depending on how big your target population is (consider the difference between a retail shop with 400 customers that they want to survey and a market research firm trying to gather data on middle-aged Americans).

**Questions**

Determine what type of information you're hoping to get first, and then draft questions that will help you gather these details. You may want to use multiple choice questions with a provided list of responses (what tools do you use for blogging?). You may want to use questions with a rating scale (how satisfied are you with your blogging platform?). Or you may want to include open-ended questions (which blogging tool could you not live without?).

**Preparing the Survey**

For online surveys, you may choose to use a tool like Google Forms, Survey Monkey, Wufoo, Typeform, or LimeSurvey. Once you've drafted a set of survey questions, get feedback from a few friends or colleagues. They'll let you know if some of the wording seems odd or if the answer options don't seem totally right.

**Tips**

Include demographic questions if you want a general idea of who the respondents are.

Include use or tool questions if you're curious about the tools or products they use.

Keep the survey as short as possible.

If the survey continues onto more than one page, include an indication of progress so that the respondent has some idea of how many questions are left.

Open-ended questions can be handy, but don't ask too many if you're expecting a lot of responses. They can be harder to analyze.

## Questions for a survey

_(Build a collection of questions to ask in user surveys by taking these starters and customizing the information to fit what you’re studying. While interview questions are great when they're open-ended, survey questions are easier to analyze when they're discretely quantifiable. You may want to include a mix of different types of questions in your survey. Surveys vary in length and format, but shorter surveys are often preferred by users.)_

When creating questions for your survey, consider:

* How can you find out more about who your users are?
* How can you find out more about what your users want to accomplish?
* How can you find out more about what your users are looking for?
