# Process Management

Process management is a crucial aspect of operating systems that deals with the creation, execution, and termination of processes. A process is an instance of a program that is being executed by the computer. Process management involves managing the resources required by processes, such as memory and CPU time, and ensuring that processes are executed efficiently and effectively. It also involves managing the communication and synchronization between processes and handling any conflicts that may arise. The process manager, a component of the operating system, is responsible for managing processes and ensuring that they run smoothly. Process management plays a crucial role in the overall performance and efficiency of a computer system.
