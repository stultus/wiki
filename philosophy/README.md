Notes from Harvard university lecture: [Justice: What's the right thing to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY\&feature=youtu.be)
{% endhint %}

* Philosophy teaches us and unsettles us by confronting us with what we already know. There is an irony - it teaches us what we already know. It works by taking what we know from familiar unquestioned settings and making it strange.&#x20;
* Philosophy estranges us from the familiar, not by supplying new information but by inviting and provoking a new way of seeing. &#x20;
* Here is the risk: once the familiar turns strange, it is never quite the same again. Self-knowledge is like lost innocence. However unsettling you find it, it can never be unthought or unknown.&#x20;
* Philosophy is a distancing, even debilitating activity.&#x20;
* &#x20;Philosophy distances us from conventions from established assumptions and from settled beliefs.&#x20;
*   Moral Reasoning

    * Consequentialist -   Locates morality in the consequences of an act
      * eg: [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism)&#x20;
    * Categorical - Locates morality in certain duties and rights
