* Introduced by [Jeremy Bentham](jeremy-bentham.md) - an 18th-century English political philosopher.&#x20;
* The right thing to do, the just thing to do is to maximize utility
* Utility: pleasure over pain, happiness over suffering
* All human beings are governed by two sovereign masters:  pain and pleasure. We like pleasure and dislike pain
* The right thing to do individually or collectively is to maximize the overall level of happiness.&#x20;
* `"The greatest good for the greatest number."`
* Bentham's version of utilitarianism:  The highest principle of morality - whether personal or political morality -  is to maximize the general welfare or the collective happiness or the overall balance of pleasure over pain:  "maximize utility"
* Bentham tells us to maximize utility as a principle not only for individuals but also for communities and legislators.&#x20;
* In deciding the best policy, in deciding what the law should be, in deciding what's just, citizens and legislators should as themselves the question - if we add up all of the benefits of this policy and subtract all of the costs, the right thing to do is the one that maximizes the happiness over suffering - that is what it means to maximize utility.&#x20;
* The above point is usually achieved using [cost-benefit analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit\_analysis). which is used by companies and by governments all the time.   it involves placing a value - usually a dollar value - to stand for utility, and the costs and the benefits of various proposals.
* In cost-benefit analysis, associating a dollar value to human life has raised controversies.   &#x20;
