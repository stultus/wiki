# Fonts

A font is a set of graphical symbols, called glyphs, that is used to represent text in a digital document. It defines the appearance of text, including the shape, size, and style of the characters. Fonts are used to display text in a variety of contexts, including on the web, in documents, and in software applications.

There are many different types of fonts, including serif, sans-serif, monospace, and decorative fonts. Serif fonts have small lines at the ends of the strokes that make up the characters, while sans-serif fonts do not have these lines. Monospace fonts have a fixed width for all characters, which makes them useful for displaying code and other text that requires precise alignment. Decorative fonts are designed to be used for special purposes, such as headlines or logos.

Fonts are an important aspect of typography, which is the art and technique of designing and setting type. They are used to create hierarchy, contrast, and balance in a document, and can have a significant impact on the overall appearance and readability of text.

There are many different font formats, including TrueType, OpenType, and PostScript. These formats define the outlines of the glyphs in a font and include other information, such as character mapping and metadata.
