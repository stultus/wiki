When to use interviews:

* When you're conducting needs finding
* When you want to see how someone works in their environment
* When you want to access the needs, tools, and workflows of your user or target customer
* When you want to gather detailed information on attitudes, desires, and experiences from your user or target customer

**Participants**

* Between 5 and 8 people is a good number to aim for when you're conducting a quick set of interviews
* Schedule more people than you need to talk to. There's usually at least one person who forgets and runs into scheduling conflicts.
* You may need to recruit from an existing user email list, from social networks, from family and friends, or from other interest groups.
* If you're providing compensation of some sort, things like Amazon gift cards, prepaid debit cards, and Starbucks cards can be sent digitally.
* If you're providing some form of compensation or reward in person, you may consider food (free lunch!), coffee/beverages, company swag, or checks (\$$) as options.

**Game Plan**

* Create a screener survey that you can post online or send around. Be sure to gather contact info, and follow up with anyone who you'd like to schedule for an interview.
* Send a confirmation email to everyone you want to schedule telling them their interview time and explaining how they can join the interview (phone number, web link).
* Prepare some questions for the interview. Consider starting with something more general and open-ended, then moving into questions that get more specific, and wrapping up with a "big change" question.
* Ideally get at least two people involved to help with the interview: one person to ask the questions and one person to take notes.
* Prepare audio and/or video solutions to record the interview.
* Take time after the sessions to debrief and list out high-level thoughts.

**Timing**

* With quick user interviews, you can pull a whole session together in a week.
* Once you have your recruitment survey, allow between a few days to a week to recruit and schedule people.
* During this time you can be writing your questions.
* Ideally, you can schedule your interviews together in blocks.
* If you expect to spend 15 minutes doing an interview, leave yourself a 30 minute window. If you expect to spend 30 minutes doing an interview, leave yourself a 45 minute window.

## Sample Script for Interviewers

Hi, I’m **\[INTERVIEWER NAME]**, and sitting next to me is **\[NOTETAKER NAME]**.

Thanks for taking the time to talk with us today!

We’re doing a little research on **\[pet gerbils]**, and we want to learn more about the products that **\[gerbil owners]** use when they **\[take care of their gerbils]**.

We wanted to have a quick conversation with you today and ask you about your experiences as a **\[gerbil owner]**. Our call shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.

Do you mind if we record this call for our notes? The recording won’t be published or shared outside our team, it just helps us with our notetaking.

_(Wait for confirmation before turning on the recording. If the participant doesn’t agree to the recording, continue without it.)_

Great! To get started, could you think back to the last time you **\[fed your gerbil]** and walk through the steps you took?

_(To get started, get the participant to start describing some aspect of how they use whatever you’re studying. As the interview progresses, draw from your list of prepared probe questions. Use clarifying questions to gather more details around things they say. Don’t be afraid to ask about something you haven’t written down if they say something interesting.)_

That’s it for my questions. Is there anything else that you’d like to add that I haven’t asked you about?

_(Give the participant a chance to respond.)_

Thank you so much for taking the time to have this conversation about **\[gerbils]**. Your input has been very helpful.

I’ll be sending out your **\[awesome incentive]** later today, so check your **\[email/mail/where ever it’s going]**.

Thank you again for your time!

## **Sample** Questions for an interview
