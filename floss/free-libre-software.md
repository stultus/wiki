# Free(libre) Software

Free (also known as libre) software refers to software that is freely available to use, modify, and distribute. The term "free" in this context refers to freedom, not cost, and it means that users have the freedom to use the software for any purpose, to modify the source code, and to distribute copies of the software to others.

Free software is typically released under a license that grants users these freedoms, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL). This allows users to not only use the software for their own purposes, but also to modify and improve the software, and to share their modifications with others.

Free software is an important movement that promotes the ideals of freedom, transparency, and collaboration in the world of software development. It allows users to have control over the software they use, and to be able to customize and modify it to meet their specific needs. It also encourages the development of software that is open, transparent, and collaborative, rather than proprietary and closed off.
