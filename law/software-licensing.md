# Software Licensing

Software licensing is the process by which a software developer or publisher grants the user of a software application the legal right to use the software. Software licenses can take many different forms and can be based on a variety of legal principles, depending on the specific needs and goals of the developer and the user.

Software licensing is an important aspect of the software industry, as it allows developers to protect their intellectual property and to control the distribution and use of their software. It is important for users to understand the terms of the software license that they agree to, as it can have significant legal and practical implications for the use and distribution of the software.

Licenses capture people’s expectations for the behaviour, development, and use of programs. Ultimately software exists for human beings, so this topic is very important. It’s also good to understand the implications of the terms and conditions attached to pretty much every commercial program and website.
