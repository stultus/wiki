# Copyright

Copyright is a legal concept that gives the creator of an original work exclusive rights to control the use and distribution of their work. Copyright applies to a wide range of creative works, including literature, music, art, film, and software.

In most countries, copyright protection is automatic and does not require the creator to register their work or include a copyright notice. However, in some cases, registering the work with a copyright office or including a copyright notice may provide additional legal protections or make it easier to enforce the copyright.

Copyright law allows the creator of a work to control how their work is used and to prevent others from using it without their permission. This includes the right to reproduce the work, distribute copies of the work, create derivative works based on the original, and publicly perform or display the work.

Copyright law also includes provisions for the use of copyrighted works for certain purposes, such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. These provisions, known as fair use or fair dealing, allow others to use limited amounts of a copyrighted work without permission for certain purposes, as long as they do not substantially affect the market value of the work.
