# News Aggregators

The legality of news aggregation remains fuzzy.&#x20;

### Hot news and misappropriation

In the United States, the law acknowledges some "[quasi property rights](../quasi-property-right.md)" or an approximate right of ownership on ephemeral, time-sensitive information (like match scores, or stock prices). This ephemeral(short-lived), time-sensitive information is a subset of what we call "hot-news".

‌As per the United States law, you cannot copyright news (because they are facts and facts cannot be copyrighted). But when someone acquires time-sensitive facts(such as match scores and stock prices) _**as the result of organization and the expenditure of labour, skill, and money** -_ which is salable by them for money. They can claim quasi property rights on this information for a brief amount time(Exactly how much time news items remain “hot-news” is not defined, leaving that to be specified individually on a case by case basis). Because if a second party in appropriating it and selling it as its own is **endeavouring to reap where it has not sown** (highlighted parts are from the INS case verdict. For details, see below)&#x20;

The hot-news Doctrine was initially recognized in the year 1918 in the United States in the case [**International** **News Service v. Associated Press**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_News\_Service\_v.\_Associated\_Press) **(**INS v. AP or simply INS case). **** The decision of the INS case introduced the legal principle of misappropriation as a "quasi-property right". This doctrine is also known as the INS doctrine.&#x20;

‌As per the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misappropriation\_doctrine), The current viability of the misappropriation doctrine is uncertain because of subsequent developments in U.S. patent and copyright law that "preempt" state law that operates in the same field of law
