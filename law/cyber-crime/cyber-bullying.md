## What is Cyber Bullying

Cyberbullying is the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. It can take many forms, including sending harassing or threatening emails, posting abusive or harassing messages on social media or other online platforms, or spreading rumours or false information about someone online.

Cyberbullying can have serious and long-lasting effects on the victim, including feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety. It can also lead to problems with self-esteem, concentration, and academic performance. In severe cases, cyberbullying can even result in physical harm or even suicide.

## How Indian law defines it?

In India, cyberbullying is generally covered under the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act). The IT Act is a comprehensive legislation that deals with various aspects of the use of information technology in India, including cybercrime.

Under the IT Act, cyberbullying is considered a form of cybercrime and is punishable by law.In addition to the IT Act, several states in India have enacted their own legislation to address cyberbullying and other forms of cybercrime. For example, the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act, 1998 specifically criminalizes cyberbullying and other forms of online harassment of women.

## Cyber Bullying laws in other countries

Cyberbullying is a growing concern in many countries around the world, and many countries have enacted laws and regulations to address this problem. Here are a few examples of how some countries have addressed cyberbullying:

* In the United States, cyberbullying is generally not a federal crime, but it may be prosecuted under state laws or as a violation of federal civil rights laws. Many states have enacted their own laws specifically addressing cyberbullying, and some have created task forces or other initiatives to address the issue.
* In Canada, cyberbullying is generally addressed through existing laws that prohibit harassment, intimidation, and hate crimes. In 2013, the federal government passed the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act, which criminalizes the non-consensual distribution of intimate images and provides for penalties of up to five years in prison.
* In the United Kingdom, cyberbullying is covered under the Malicious Communications Act, 1988 and the Protection from Harassment Act, 1997. These laws criminalize the sending of threatening or abusive messages or the posting of abusive or threatening material online.
* In Australia, cyberbullying is generally addressed through state and territory laws that criminalize stalking, harassment, and offensive behaviour. In 2013, the federal government released the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children, which included a range of initiatives to address cyberbullying, including the development of online resources and the establishment of a national reporting system for cyberbullying incidents.
