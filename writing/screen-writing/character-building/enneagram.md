# Enneagram

The Enneagram is a personality typing system that divides people into nine different types, each with its own distinct traits and characteristics. It is based on the belief that individuals have a fundamental way of perceiving and responding to the world, and that this perspective shapes their behaviours and actions. The nine Enneagram types are described as a series of points on a circle, with each point representing a different set of core motivations, fears, and desires. The Enneagram can be a helpful tool for self-discovery and personal growth. It provides insight into how an individual's thinking and behaviour patterns may be influenced by their underlying motivations and fears. It can also be useful for building stronger relationships, as it can help individuals better understand and communicate with others who may have different personality types.

In screenwriting, the Enneagram can be a useful tool for creating well-rounded and believable characters. By determining a character's Enneagram type, a screenwriter can gain insight into the character's motivations, fears, and desires, and use this information to shape their actions and decisions in the story. For example, a character who is an Enneagram Type 2, known as the Helper, might be motivated by a desire to be needed and appreciated and may make decisions based on this desire to be helpful and supportive to others. By understanding the Enneagram type of a character, a screenwriter can more fully flesh out the character's personality and create a more believable and relatable character for audiences. In addition to character development, the Enneagram can also be useful for understanding and improving relationships between characters in a story, as it provides insight into how different personality types may interact and communicate.



The Enneagram can be a useful tool for creating fully-realized and believable characters in a screenplay. Here is a detailed look at how each of the nine Enneagram types could be used for character building:

1. **The Perfectionist**: Perfectionists are known for their high standards and sense of responsibility. They are organized, reliable, and hardworking, and often strive for excellence in all areas of their lives. A character with the traits of a Perfectionist might be depicted as a perfectionistic and overachieving workaholic, or as someone who puts a lot of pressure on themselves and others to be perfect.
2. **The Helper**: Helpers are known for their caring and supportive nature. They are empathetic, kind, and often put the needs of others before their own. A character with the traits of a Helper might be depicted as a selfless caregiver or as someone who is constantly seeking to be needed and appreciated by others.
3. **The Achiever**: Achievers are driven, ambitious, and success-oriented. They are goal-oriented and work hard to achieve their objectives, often seeking recognition and validation for their efforts. A character with the traits of an Achiever might be depicted as a driven and ambitious careerist, or as someone who is constantly striving for success and recognition.
4. **The Individualist**: Individualists are introspective, sensitive, and creative. They value uniqueness and authenticity, and often seek to express their individuality in their appearance and personal style. A character with the traits of an Individualist might be depicted as a sensitive and introspective artist, or as someone who is deeply attuned to their own emotions and needs.
5. **The Investigator**: Investigators are analytical, intelligent, and perceptive. They value knowledge and understanding, and often seek to learn and understand as much as possible about the world around them. A character with the traits of an Investigator might be depicted as a curious and analytical researcher, or as someone who is always seeking to learn and understand more about the world around them.
6. **The Loyalist**: Loyalists are reliable, responsible, and supportive. They value security and seek to create stability in their lives and relationships. A character with the traits of a Loyalist might be depicted as a dependable and supportive friend or family member, or as someone who is anxious and fearful about change.
7. **The Enthusiast**: Enthusiasts are energetic, optimistic, and spontaneous. They value new experiences and often seek out new adventures. A character with the traits of an Enthusiast might be depicted as a fun-loving and adventurous risk-taker, or as someone who is always seeking new experiences and excitement.
8. **The Challenger**: Challengers are assertive, confident, and self-assured. They value strength and control, and often strive to be in charge. A character with the traits of a Challenger might be depicted as a strong and confident leader, or as someone who is aggressive and controlling.
9. **The Peacemaker**: Peacemakers are easy-going, accepting, and non-confrontational. They value harmony and often strive to create peace and understanding in their relationships and environments. A character with the traits of a Peacemaker might be depicted as a mediator or peacemaker, or as someone who is too passive and avoids conflict at all costs.

In the Enneagram system, each type is connected to one another through a series of lines that represent the various relationships and connections between the types. These lines indicate the ways in which one type may influence or be influenced by another.

There are three main lines that connect the Enneagram types: the wings, the arrows, and the stress and security points.

The wings are the types that are adjacent to a person's primary Enneagram type. For example, a person with the primary type of 4 (the Individualist) might have a wing of 3 (the Achiever) or a wing of 5 (the Investigator). The wings can influence a person's behavior and perspective, and may provide a different perspective or balance to a person's primary type.

The arrows represent the directions in which a person may move under stress or in a healthy state. For example, a person with the primary type of 8 (the Challenger) may move towards the direction of 1 (the Perfectionist) under stress, or towards the direction of 2 (the Helper) in a healthy state.

The stress and security points represent the types that a person may turn to for support or guidance when they are feeling stressed or secure. For example, a person with the primary type of 6 (the Loyalist) may turn to the type of 9 (the Peacemaker) for support when they are feeling stressed, or to the type of 3 (the Achiever) when they are feeling secure.

Overall, the Enneagram system is based on the idea that each type is interconnected and that each type has the potential to influence and be influenced by the other types. Understanding these connections can provide insight into how an individual's primary Enneagram type may be affected by other factors, such as their surroundings, relationships, and personal experiences.



The wings, arrows, and stress and security points are important aspects of the Enneagram system that provide insight into how an individual's Enneagram type may be influenced or expressed. Here is a detailed look at how these concepts apply to each of the nine Enneagram types:

1. **The Perfectionist**: The wings of a Perfectionist are types 2 (the Helper) and 1 (the Perfectionist). Under stress, a Perfectionist may move towards the direction of 7 (the Enthusiast) or 8 (the Challenger). In a healthy state, they may move towards the direction of 4 (the Individualist) or 9 (the Peacemaker). The stress and security points for a Perfectionist are types 6 (the Loyalist) and 5 (the Investigator).
2. **The Helper**: The wings of a Helper are types 3 (the Achiever) and 1 (the Perfectionist). Under stress, a Helper may move towards the direction of 6 (the Loyalist) or 5 (the Investigator). In a healthy state, they may move towards the direction of 8 (the Challenger) or 9 (the Peacemaker). The stress and security points for a Helper are types 4 (the Individualist) and 7 (the Enthusiast).
3. **The Achiever**: The wings of an Achiever are types 4 (the Individualist) and 2 (the Helper).
