# Seven Basic Plots

The seven basic plots can be used to understand the structure of a story and the way in which the plot unfolds. Here is a more detailed look at how each of the seven basic plots can be used to create a story structure:

1. **Overcoming the Monster**: In this plot, the story structure typically follows a clear and concise arc, with the main character starting out in a position of relative normalcy before being confronted with the monster or threat. The story then follows the main character's efforts to overcome the monster and achieve their goal, with the climax of the story occurring when the main character finally defeats the monster.
2. **Rags to Riches**: This plot follows a similar structure, with the main character starting out in a disadvantaged or humbled position and working towards achieving wealth and success. The story may include obstacles and challenges that the main character must overcome in order to achieve their goal, and the climax of the story typically occurs when the main character finally achieves their desired status or wealth.
3. **The Quest**: In this plot, the story structure follows the main character's journey to achieve a specific goal or acquire an important object or knowledge. The story may include a series of challenges and obstacles that the main character must overcome in order to reach their goal, and the climax of the story typically occurs when the main character finally achieves their objective.
4. **Voyage and Return**: This plot follows a structure in which the main character embarks on a journey and encounters challenges and adventures along the way. The story may include a series of highs and lows as the main character grapples with the challenges and changes that come with their journey. The climax of the story typically occurs when the main character reaches their destination and experiences a realization or transformation that allows them to return home with a new understanding or perspective.
5. **Comedy**: In this plot, the story structure often follows a light-hearted and humorous trajectory, with the main character experiencing a series of amusing or absurd situations and events. The story may include obstacles or challenges that the main character must overcome, but these are typically portrayed in a comedic or light-hearted manner. The climax of the story typically occurs when the main character achieves their goal or resolves the conflict in a humorous or satisfying way.
6. **Tragedy**: In this plot, the story structure follows the main character's journey towards a tragic downfall or loss. The story may include a series of events or circumstances that lead the main character towards their tragic end, and the climax of the story typically occurs when the main character reaches their lowest point or experiences their greatest loss.
7. **Rebirth**: This plot follows the main character's journey of personal growth and transformation, often through a process of suffering or redemption. The story may include a series of challenges or hardships that the main character must overcome in order to achieve their transformation, and the climax of the story typically occurs when the main character reaches a point of enlightenment or understanding that allows them to achieve their goal. Overall, the seven basic plots provide a framework for understanding the structure and progression of a story, and can be used to create a wide range of narratives.
