# Academic Papers

To be honest, I haven't read many academic papers. But I always wanted to. Recently I've made progress in this area while brainstorming about different areas related to the [PeARS project](../projects/pears/).  

Then [Nandaja](https://nandaja.space) shared a link to a 2017 blog post by a certain individual called [Michael Feathers](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/bio), called - [10 Papers Every Developer Should Read](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/10-papers-every-developer-should-read-at-least-twice). So this is my attempt to start a long lasting habbit of reading academic papaers.  I'll be starting with the papers listed in the above blog post. I'll also include the papers I read before. Let's hope it works.
