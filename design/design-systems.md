# Design Systems

A design system is a set of standardized guidelines for the design and development of a product, such as a website or app. It includes elements like color palettes, typography, iconography, and other visual and interactive elements, as well as code and other assets that can be reused across different projects. The goal of a design system is to create a consistent and cohesive user experience, while also streamlining the design and development process by providing a set of reusable components. A design system can be applied to a wide range of products, including digital products like websites and apps, as well as physical products like packaging and marketing materials. It is an important tool for companies that want to maintain a strong and consistent brand identity across all of their products.
