# Computer Science

Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems, including their design, development, and use. It encompasses a wide range of fields and disciplines, including computer programming, algorithms, data structures, computer hardware and software design, computer networks, and more.

The history of computer science dates back to the early 20th century, with the development of the first electronic computers and the pioneering work of researchers such as Alan Turing and John von Neumann. In the decades that followed, computer science has continued to evolve and expand, driven by advances in technology and the growing reliance on computers in a wide range of fields.
